# Photo Colorization Using Deep Learning

## Complete Python Application With GUI Using PySimpleGUI

### ___Important___

In order to run the demo, you will first need to download the pre-trained data from this location. At 125 MB it's too large to put into the GitHub.  Place the file in the model folder.

## The Zhang Algorithm

The colorization algorithm was developed by Zhang, et al, and is detailed here:

http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/

## PyImageSearch

The code implementing the algorithm is explained in a well-written tutorial by the fine folks at PyImageSearch:

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/02/25/black-and-white-image-colorization-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/


## Using the GUI

To use the GUI you'll need to install PySimpleGUI (http://www.PySimpleGUI.org for instructions)

One of these will install it for you.
```
pip install PySimpleGUI
pip3 install PySimpleGUI
```

Then you run the demo program using either `python` or `python3` dependind on your system:

```
python PySimpleGUI_Colorizer.py
python3 PySimpleGUI_Colorizer.py
```

### You have 2 options for choosing the image to colorize.

#### Folder View

If you choose a folder in the left column, then a list of files will be shown.  Clicking on a file will "Preview" the image on the right side.  Either copy and paste a path into the input box in the upper left corner, or use the `Browse` button to browse for a folder

#### Individual File

You can also choose an individual file using the input box in the upper right.  Either paste a filename into the box or use the `browse` button to choose one.

### Webcam

Press the `Start Webcam` button to see yourself colorized in realtime. It's not super fast, but it does function.

Press the `Stop Webcam` button to stop.

## Saving The Color Image

To save your image simply press the `Save File` button and enter your filename.

# Webcam Multi-Window Demo

In July 2020 a new demo was added that uses the new (released to GitHub only at this point) multi-window support.  This demo shows 3 video windows:

1. Your webcam's raw video stream
2. Grayscale version of the video
3. Fully colorized colored of the grayscale video

Here's a screenshot to give you a rough idea of what to expect from the demo.  The colors likely didn't do so well in this specific shot as there was a lot of background lighting.

You will need to use the PySimpleGUI.py file from the project's GitHub http://www.PySimpleGUI.com.  Minimum version is 4.26.0.13.
